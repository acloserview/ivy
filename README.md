A very minimalistic but colorful png icon theme for X11 Desktop Environments such as: Xfce & LXQt heavily inspired by the [FatCow](http://www.fatcow.com/free-icons) & [Tango!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tango_Desktop_Project) icons under [CC-BY-SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en)

* Prebuilt set for Download: [Ivy@deviantart](http://sixsixfive.deviantart.com/art/Ivy-371216510)

#####Goals:

- try to create a generic icon theme from scratch
- no reflections (glossy highlights) or big fat icon shadows (the main difference to tango)
- no monochrome osx-like or blocky iphone-like icons

#####Howto create a png icon theme:

**Note:** *We make a png theme because it's faster and pixel perfect*

* **`cd ~`**
* **`git clone https://github.com/sixsixfive/ivy.git`**
* **`cd ivy`**
* **`bash createpngset`**

####Limitations/Bugs:

* some smaller icons are fuzzy cause they are scaled down from other sizes(sry, but I don't have plenty of time but someday they will be complete I guess ;)
* some icons are still missing(that's just a matter of time ;) 
* Due Xfce bug [10126](https://bugzilla.xfce.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10126) it's impossible to select any icons in the built-in *.desktop editor
